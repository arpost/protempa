${project.name} ${project.version} -- A Temporal Query Framework for Clinical Databases
Department of Biomedical Informatics, ${project.organization.name}

OVERVIEW

${project.description}

WHAT'S NEW

Version 2.3 now requires Java 7 compatibility. Ability to search for 
propositions from knowledge sources was added.  A new module for using 
BioPortal as a knowledge source was added.

Version 2.2 eliminates the need to run separate queries to hook up references
between propositions, significantly reducing the number of quries generated
and execution time.

Version 2.0.3 includes the following new features and changes:
* We added a new abstraction type called compound low-level abstraction. This
lets you infer abstract parameters from one or more other low-level
abstractions or compound low-level abstractions.
* We made toString()'s behavior more uniform across the framework. We use the
Apache ToStringBuilder and friends in most places.
* We moved the packages to our new public Maven repository (see below).
* Various other bug fixes.

Note that Protempa's public APIs are subject to change. A stable ABI will be 
part of a future release.

REQUIREMENTS

The current version is known to work with Oracle Java 7. It is expected to work
with OpenJDK 7 as well.

Protempa uses the Maven build system, available from http://maven.apache.org. 
You must install maven, if you do not already have it, to work with the source 
code. We use Maven 3.
